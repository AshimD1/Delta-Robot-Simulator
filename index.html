    <p>A delta robot is a type of parallel robot that consists of three arms connected at the base by universal joints.
         The usage of parallelograms in the arms, which preserves the end effector's alignment, is the fundamental design element.
         Delta robot is one of the most common parallel robot manipulators, 
        because it is usually applied to operate apick-and-place task under the requirements of high movingspeed and 
        high positioning accuracy. Delta robots are frequently used in factories for picking and 
        packaging tasks because they can work quicklyâ€”some may complete up to 300 picks per minute. </p>
